      <h2>Understanding Color Assignment</h2>

      <div>
        <h3><a href="images/pictureimage1.PNG">Kindergarden Teacher</a></h3>
        <img src="images/kindercolors.PNG" alt="">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          The reason i choose these four colors was because these are some of the most basic colors. You  will see a kindergarten teacher using these colors most of the time, reason being why is because like the kids are young and don't really know that much about complex colors so they use basic colors. Mostly everyone learns about these colors because these are the colors we see all over the place.

        <h3><a href="images/landscape_page.PNg">Land Scape colors</a></h3>
        <img src="images/landscape_colors.png" alt="">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          The reason being why i choose this color was because when  you think about landscape you think about green because landscape sounds like a peaceful place with green trees and just miles and miles of green tall grass where people go to relax and have a wonderful time with your family or your loved ones. Landscape is a nice thing to look at and to get things off your mind and relax and not worry about anything, not stress out because it nice and quiet and peaceful.
