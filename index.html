        <h2> Unit 1: Designing and Planning a Website</h2>
          <p>The most important vocabulary terms was tags, coding, and styles. Some of the most important tags are p tags, div tag, h2 tag, h1 tag. what they mean or what they are for is so we can.</p>
          <p>The most important skills that I learned was to set up a website/webpage, which was my first time and i felt like i did good for the first time.</p>
          <p>The ways I have got better at this by practicing everyday and when I would do that it would stay in my head and I would remember the bisics.</p>
          <p>Some of the improvement i need is where to place things like by myself but i need help, someone to tell me where it goes and after that i know what to do.</p>
          <p>Some of the problems that ive encounterd were the placing of things like i didnt know where they would go so i would ask the teacher for help or sometimes i would even ask my friends for help.</p>
          <p>In my opinion i felt that the most satifying part was the process, starting from blank to work all over my page and i cant wait for finished product.</p>
          <p>If i was the teacher some of the comments i would make is that the process we are doing is amazing for being a beginer at Web Design.</p>

        <h2> Unit 2: Color</h2>

          <p>The most impotamt vocabulary terms would be styles and tags. A couple of the tags I find imporant are the p tags, div tags, h2 tags and h1 tags. They are really impotant to maintain our webpage/website.</p>
          <p>The important skills that i've learned throughtout this course is that ive learned things that I never knew even exited, these things will help me out when I go to college.</p>
          <p>The ways I have got better at this is by practicing everyday and looking at vidoes that the teacher has asighned up and also play some games that help me understangd more and more about HTML.</p>
          <p>Some of the improvement I have made are learning how to improve my website/webpage by adding stylesheet and making my webpage not lame and very intresting.</p>
          <p>Some of the problems I have encontered are not being able to add some comments and i had a lot of trouble adding the reflections and the way I was able to fix them was by asking my teacher for help.</p>
          <p>In my opinion it felt really satifying with the process I started making from my blank page to to adding many things for example divs, h1 tags, h2 tags, adding colors, styles, and making my page intresting.</p>
          <p>If I was the teacher some of the comments I would make of this peice is that i am making great progress with all the work i am making for being a beginer to Web Design.</p>
